//When you need a certain piece of functionality, you can write it in a 
//reusable service. Via dependency injection, that service can be injected
//into other services or classes when needed

//Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection
//Think of some controller who is dependent on lets say logging service plus some other service
//if we do not inject we'd have to write that service for each method inside the controller
//meaning class implementation has to change when a dependency changes and it makes it more difficult to test
//since the logger we're getting is a concrete type and we won't be able to pass mock types in our test
//lastly the class also need to manage the life time of the service as well - in short this makes the class tightly coupled

//this is where Inversion of Control comes to the rescue
//IoC delegates the function of selecting a concrete implementation type for a class's dependencies to an external component
//We accomplish that by Dependency Injection - it is a specialization of the Inversion of Control pattern which uses an object - 
//the container - to intializae objects and provide the required dependencies to the object

//All apis require certain some logging and we'll be injecting logger

// Add services to the container.
